TO: Lovro Meski
FROM: Ivanich Drovkeh

May this letter find you well, comrade.
This letter is to report to you the status of the our current situation here in the frozen forest shelters, I am unable to relay this message via telegram due to our devices being broken. Currently our base of operations have gone from bad to terrible to worse, the food supply has run low, it will be months before our garden rooms can be harvested, we don't have months to last and it won't be a bountiful harvest either. Our water filtering systems broke due to an earthquake that caused multiple casualties. our base was almost ravaged by the infected mobs... I saw my wife and daughter that day, they are not doing so well. We are barely holding on, the infected mutated once more and can now grow in size and strength, our walls are on the brink of breaking since three days ago, if they break, we all will cease to be, along with your research.

I beseech you comrade, please come help us.

May God bless thee,
Ivanich Drovkeh.
