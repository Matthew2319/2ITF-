"Recording Number 51A, February 29, 2082. This is Irene Meski, studying and researching what's known to be "the infected." such a deragatory term for a mere disease that can be easily snuffed out by the superiority of science and technology, but not human decisiveness and efficiency. Regardless, I am to archive in this recording the current discoveries our group has found about the "infected"."

"The "infected" are described by the public as "hideous mutated monsters with claws and fangs" which is accurate. based on the footage provided by several sources, the infected are transformed into humanoid monsters with thin limbs and body structure, slimy flesh-like texture with long fingers and toes, walks on four limbs with animalistic like movement, preys on human beings as a means of attaining sustenance or converting humans into The Infected."

"Currently, there is no known "cure" or way to reverse them back to human, nor is there a way to fully terminate one as we still know so little of how to combat it."

This is the end of the recording.
